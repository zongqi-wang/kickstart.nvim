What is Kickstart?

  Kickstart.nvim is *not* a distribution.

  Kickstart.nvim is a starting point for your own configuration.
    The goal is that you can read every line of code, top-to-bottom, understand
    what your configuration is doing, and modify it to suit your needs.

    Once you've done that, you can start exploring, configuring and tinkering to
    make Neovim your own! That might mean leaving Kickstart just the way it is for a while
    or immediately breaking it into modular pieces. It's up to you!

    If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
    a guide. One possible example which will only take 10-15 minutes:
      - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

    After understanding a bit more about Lua, you can use `:help lua-guide` as a
    reference for how Neovim integrates Lua.
    - :help lua-guide
    - (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html
